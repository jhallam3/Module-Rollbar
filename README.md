Skeleton for a Decisions Module

IF you're a developer or partner looking to make a module to deploy in a Decisions environment, this is a skeleton for a best practice module setup.

Using this setup you can:
1. have a simple way for a new developer to checkout and immediately be able to build the module 
2. have a developer able to test and run this module on a local developer environment of Decisions
